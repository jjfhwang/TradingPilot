# TradingPilot

A robust and extensible framework for algorithmic trading, built with Rust for performance and reliability.

## Description

TradingPilot provides a foundation for building sophisticated trading strategies. It handles the complexities of market data ingestion, order execution, risk management, and backtesting, allowing developers to focus on creating innovative trading algorithms. This framework leverages Rust's memory safety and concurrency features to ensure stability and speed in real-time trading environments. TradingPilot aims to abstract away the low-level details of interacting with exchanges, offering a clean and well-defined API for strategy development and deployment.

## Features

*   **Market Data Handling:**  Provides a standardized interface for subscribing to and processing real-time market data feeds from various exchanges. Supports multiple data formats and allows for easy integration of new data sources.
*   **Order Execution:**  Enables automated order placement, modification, and cancellation with robust error handling and order status tracking. Supports various order types, including market, limit, and stop orders.
*   **Risk Management:**  Implements configurable risk management rules to protect capital and prevent excessive losses. Allows users to define limits on position sizes, maximum drawdown, and other key risk metrics.
*   **Backtesting Engine:**  Facilitates historical simulation of trading strategies to evaluate performance and optimize parameters. Supports various backtesting methodologies and provides detailed performance reports.
*   **Extensible Architecture:**  Designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization. New strategies, data sources, and risk management rules can be added without modifying the core framework.

## Installation

To install TradingPilot, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    TradingPilot relies on several external crates for functionality. These dependencies are managed using Cargo.  Ensure you have a recent version of Rust and Cargo before proceeding. The following dependencies are required:

    *   tokio (for asynchronous runtime)
    *   serde (for serialization and deserialization)
    *   reqwest (for HTTP requests)
    *   chrono (for date and time handling)
    *   anyhow (for error handling)

    You can install these dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

    

    This command will download and compile all required dependencies.  If you encounter issues during the build process, ensure that your Rust toolchain is up to date and that you have the necessary system dependencies installed. Consult the documentation for each crate if you have specific dependency installation problems.

3.  **Verification (Optional):**

    Run the example to verify proper installation:
    
    This will compile and run a simple example strategy.

## Usage

This section demonstrates how to use TradingPilot to build and run a simple trading strategy.

First, you need to define your trading strategy. Here's an example of a simple moving average crossover strategy:



This code defines a `SimpleMovingAverageStrategy` struct that implements the `Strategy` trait. The `on_market_data` method is called for each market data event and generates buy or sell orders based on the moving average crossover. A RiskManager is consulted before placing any order.

Next, you need to create a `main` function to initialize the framework, subscribe to market data, and run the strategy:



This code creates a `SimulatedMarketDataFeed` to generate sample market data, a `SimulatedOrderExecutor` to simulate order execution, and a `SimpleMovingAverageStrategy` instance. It then iterates through the market data events, calls the `on_market_data` method of the strategy, and executes any generated orders.
